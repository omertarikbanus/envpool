# Notes 

## TODO

- Clean up codes.
- remove unused log files.


##Â Development Notes
- number of environments is crucial for succesfull training. I set them to 32 vs 128 and the training was stable only for 32 environments case. 

- frameskip variable also effects the training's success. Under same conditions with 32 envs, when frameskip was set to 15 the policy's learning was much worse.

## Basic Usage

    export USE_BAZEL_VERSION=6.4.0
    sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev #run bazel clean --expunge, then try again

If you get this error

MAC FIXES 

    symlink qt. install it if not installed.
    ln -s /usr/include/aarch64-linux-gnu/qt5 /usr/include/qt
    ln -s /usr/include/eigen3/Eigen /usr/include/Eigen
